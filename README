This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4780

This plugin enables bash templates / filtering, aka the macgyver-style of using snippets.
Shellintegration is already possible using '!' and '.!' and such, but I wanted a faster / more templated way of doing things.

FEATURES
=========

* full bashification of vim, if you are better at bashscripting compared to vimscript: this is for you
* write a filename '/etc/motd'..and press CTRL-B, it'll just include that file in the current document
* write 'snippet' and it will list the contents of ~/.vim/snippet   (snippet.vim compatible)
* single-word-executables: write 'date' in vim..press CTRL-B, then it turns into 'Mon Nov 25 10:47:40 CET 2013' (it just ran '/usr/bin/date' :)
* UPDATE: filters! you can now postprocess your snippets or current vimdocument with easy bashscripts (extension .filter)
* UPDATE: $CLASSNAME and $FILE are now passed to snippets
* UPDATE: configurationfile ~/.bashizzle for global search/replace on every included snippet 

EXAMPLE
========
Enough featureboasting, show me something!
Ok, bashizzle can easily turn something like this: http://pastie.org/8509238
into this: http://pastie.org/8509252
and optionally filter it with this: http://pastie.org/8509293

given that you properly configured your global search/replace keywords in ~/.bashizzle

Make sure you watch the screencat above
